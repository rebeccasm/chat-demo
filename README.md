You’ll complete your project step-by-step as you work through each Exercise. For each task, you’ll
submit a deliverable that directly contributes to the final product—in this case, a native mobile chat
app to demonstrate your React and React Native programming skills.
Below is a breakdown of your course project deliverables by Exercise.

Exercise 1: Building Native Applications with JavaScript
● Set up your development environment to work with React Native and Expo.
● Create the app’s layout using native UI components and style the start screen based on the
screen designs you received in this brief.

Exercise 2: Chat UIs & Accessibility
● Build the chat screen and the chat functionality with the Gifted Chat library.
